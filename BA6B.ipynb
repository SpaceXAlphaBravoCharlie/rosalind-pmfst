        "The intuition that we are trying to build is that consecutive elements like (+12 +13) are desirable because they appear in the same order as in the identity permutation. However, consecutive elements like (-11 -10) are also desirable, since these elements can be later inverted into the correct order, (+10 +11). The pairs (+12 +13) and (-11 -10) have something in common; the second element is equal to the first element plus 1. We therefore say that consecutive elements (pi pi+1) in permutation P = (p1 ... pn) form an adjacency if pi+1 - pi is equal to 1. By definition, for any positive integer k < n, both (k k + 1) and (-(k + 1) k) are adjacencies. If pi+1 - pi is not equal to 1, then we say that (pi pi+1) is a breakpoint. We can think about a breakpoint intuitively as a pair of consecutive elements that are “out of order” compared to the identity permutation (+1 +2 ... +n). For example, the pair (+5 12) is a breakpoint because +5 and -12 are not neighbors in the identity permutation. Similarly, (-12 -8), (-6 +1), (+2 +10), (+9 -11), and (-11 +13) are\n",
        "clearly out of order. But (+10 +9) is also a breakpoint (even though it is formed by consecutive integers) because its signs are out of order compared to the identity permutation. The permutation (5 4 3 2 1) is clearly not the identity permutation, but where are its breakpoints?\n",
        "We will further represent the beginning and end of permutation P by adding 0 to the left of the first element and n + 1 to the right of the last element,\n",
