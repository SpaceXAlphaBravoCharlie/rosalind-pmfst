        "The following algorithm for constructing a topological ordering is based on the observation that every DAG has at least one node with no incoming edges. We will label one of these nodes as v1 and then remove this node from the graph along with all its outgoing edges. The resulting graph is also a DAG, which in turn must have a node with no incoming edges; we label this node v2, and again remove it from the graph along with its outgoing edges. The resulting algorithm proceeds until all nodes have been removed, producing a topological order v1, . ., vn. This algorithm runs in time proportional to the number of edges in the input DAG."
